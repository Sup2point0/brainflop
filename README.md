# ` brainflop `

A simple (and probably naive and optimised) parser/compiler/interpreter(?) for the *Brainf\*ck* esolang.


## Use

Ensure you have GHC and Cabal installed, then in the project root, run:

```bash
cabal run
```

The executable will ask you to input your Brainf\*ck program code, and then it’ll execute it!
